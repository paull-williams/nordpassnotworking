Troubleshooting Steps
=====================

Step 1: Check Your Internet Connection
---------------------------------------

One of the most common reasons NordPass doesn’t work correctly is a poor or unstable internet connection. Since NordPass relies on cloud syncing, having a stable internet connection is crucial.

1. **Test your connection:** Open a browser or use another app to verify that your internet connection is active.
2. **Switch networks:** Try switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data if possible, or try connecting to a different Wi-Fi network.
3. **Reset your router:** If you're having issues with your connection, restart your router to ensure it is working properly.

Step 2: Update Your NordPass App
---------------------------------

Using an outdated version of NordPass can sometimes lead to problems, as newer updates often contain bug fixes and performance improvements.

1. **Check for updates:** 
   - On **Windows**: Open the NordPass application, click on the settings icon, and look for available updates.
   - On **Mac**: Visit the Mac App Store and check for any updates for NordPass.
   - On **iOS and Android**: Go to your respective app stores and check for updates.

2. **Install the latest version:** If an update is available, make sure to install it and restart your app.

Step 3: Clear Cache and App Data
---------------------------------

Corrupted cache files and app data can cause issues with NordPass. Clearing them can often resolve problems related to syncing, login failures, or app crashes.

1. **For Windows and Mac:**
   - Close NordPass completely.
   - Locate the application folder and delete any residual files (usually located in your AppData folder on Windows or Library on Mac).
   
2. **For Mobile Devices:**
   - Open your device settings and navigate to the NordPass app.
   - Clear cache or data (on Android devices).

Be cautious when clearing app data, as it will log you out and may remove offline access to some passwords. However, as long as you have your master password, you can log back into your account.

Step 4: Reinstall NordPass
---------------------------

If other troubleshooting methods don't work, reinstalling the app can resolve deeper software issues. This will ensure that you are starting with a fresh, uncorrupted installation of NordPass.

1. **Uninstall NordPass** from your device.
2. **Restart your device** to clear any temporary issues.
3. **Reinstall NordPass** from the official website (for desktop) or the app store (for mobile).
4. **Log back into your account** using your credentials.

Step 5: Check for Known Service Interruptions
---------------------------------------------

Occasionally, NordPass may experience downtime or service interruptions that affect its functionality. These issues are typically temporary and beyond the user’s control.

2. **Contact support** if the service is down in your region.
